### Why is this land suitable for glamping?  

✔ **Scenic location with mountain views** – an attractive setting for a nature retreat  
✔ **Established fruit plantation** – creates an eco-farm atmosphere and has income potential  
✔ **Good location** – **37 minutes from Phuket Airport, 16 minutes from Natai Beach**  
✔ **Chanote title** – ensures full ownership rights and facilitates legal transactions  

### Potential challenges  

❌ **Uneven terrain** – the land is on a slope, increasing construction costs and requiring additional planning (terracing, soil reinforcement)  
❌ **No electricity or water** – autonomous solutions (solar panels, wells, rainwater collection systems) will be necessary  
❌ **Distance from major facilities** – a **Tesco Lotus Go Fresh supermarket and hospital are 14 minutes away**, but guests should expect a secluded stay  

### Glamping potential assessment  

✅ **Beautiful natural surroundings** – ideal for retreats and eco-tourism  
✅ **Fruit orchard** – can be used for farm tours and organic food experiences  
✅ **Chanote title** – legally secure purchase  
❌ **Uneven land** – significant investment needed for leveling and construction  
❌ **No infrastructure** – budget considerations for off-grid solutions are necessary  

### Conclusion  

This land is **ideal for a retreat-style glamping site, an eco-hotel, or a countryside resort**, but it requires substantial investment in terrain preparation and infrastructure. **If your project embraces seclusion, self-sufficient solutions, and a nature-focused concept, this could be a great investment. However, infrastructure costs for utilities and land preparation should be carefully evaluated before purchase.**  

❗ **It is recommended to check the possibility of connecting water and electricity before making a decision.**
